## Basics
gityll is a static site generator that uses the github issues system as a CMS. Point gityll at a repo and you're off. 

## What?
Let's give you a map from issues -> blog
```
issue title -> post title
issue tags -> post category tags
issue assignee -> post author
issue text -> post text
```

## Features
### Current
- markdown -> html support
- html templates for posts and contents
- milligram.github.io css support
- author links and profile images
- post topic tags
- fully hacky CMS using github issues

### Proposed
- proper syntax highlighting for code blocks
- filtering by tag
- full github flavoured markdown support
- username.github.io auto export
- express support
- and probably much more...

## Issues
The current version is mostly hacked together, you can see of the proposed changes in the issues section, or, at the gityll generated page. <a href="http://aranlong.co.uk/gityllissues">gityll issues</a>.
